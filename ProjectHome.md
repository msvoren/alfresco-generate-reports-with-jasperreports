## Server-side javascript service to generate Jasper report from XML data-source which is generated by FTL ##

### How it works ###
- create FTL which will be executed agains Alfresco repository that will produce XML data-source

- create Jasper report using iReport and place it on repository

- use Server-side alfresco javascript to execute FTL and execute **alfresco-jasper-report service** with provided jasper-report node


### Installation ###
  * copy jar libraries to your /alfresco/WEB-INF/lib/ folder
    * alfrescoJasperReports.jar
    * jasper report libraries (jasperreports-4.0.2.jar, jasperreports-applet-4.0.2.jar, jasperreports-fonts-4.0.2.jar, jasperreports-javaflow-4.0.2.jar)
    * other dependency jars. Note that alfresco already contains commons-, iText and log4j  libraries. Only iText-2.1.7.jar is necessary to copy to lib folder. It won't cause problems to existing one (newer)
  * copy context file jasperreports-example-context.xml to your extension folder
  * restart alfresco

### Running test example ###
  * create folder _TestAlfrescoJasperReports_ in your company home
  * upload test FTL JRXML files: datasource\_itemsInDataDictionary.ftl, report\_itemsInDataDictionary.jrxml
  * upload generateReport.js server-side script to alfresco and execute it
  * generated document will have timestamped name
  * alfresco JS service syntax:
```
jasperReportsHelper.generateXMLDataSourceReport( 	
						xmlDataSourceString, 
						xpath report query, 
						nodeRef object of japer report document located on repository, 
						nodeRef object of destination folder to place generated report,
						output format ["pdf", "xls", "docx"]
		   );
```


### Comments ###
  * source files can be found on svn on this project
  * any comments and updates are welcome!
